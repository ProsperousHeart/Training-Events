# This is step 3 of the "Bare Bones" Process - Creating The Empty Functions
# Here is the process I follow for this phase ...
#
#   1 - write out the comments of expected functions
#   2 - create those functions with proper docstrings, logging, and pass ONLY
#       NOTE:  pass is a null operation (nothing happens) and is therefore
#              only used as a placeholder when no code needs to be executed
#              such as when a function doesn't do anything yet or have logging
#   3 - tie the functions together in your __main__
#   4 - test the logic with print or logging statements
